            Find an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for a domestic property
        </h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Use this service to find EPCs for properties in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.<br /><br />

            An EPC lists the energy rating of a property.<br /><br />

            It also has advice about how to improve the energy performance of a property.<br /><br />

            You need an EPC when you build, sell or let a domestic property. It is valid for 10 years.
