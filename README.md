# EPB Prototypes
This is where we store our prototypes.

## How to install

### Pre-requisites
- You need node & npm installed on your device
- You need to understand how to use Terminal or Putty

### How to
- Clone repo, `git clone git@github.com:communitiesuk/epb-prototypes.git`
- run `npm install`
- run `node start`
- go to [localhost](https://localhost:80) in your browser
  - In case localhost doesn't work: some systems might have  service already listening 
  on port 80. Simply read the console output from `node start` to identify your port
